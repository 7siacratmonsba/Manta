## |VERIFIED| Keygen Autocad 2013 Per Windows 8

 
![
<p>Unfortunately, Dean's answer is accurate. AutoCAD 2013 is not compatible with Windows 10 operating system. This means that you will not be able to run the software properly on your computer if you have Windows 10 installed. To solve this problem, you have two options: either upgrade to the latest version of AutoCAD (you can download a free trial here) or downgrade your operating system to Windows 7 or 8. The latest version of AutoCAD has many new features and improvements that you might find useful, while Windows 7 or 8 are still supported by AutoCAD 2013.</p>

If you decide to upgrade to the latest version of AutoCAD, you will need to check the system requirements and make sure that your computer meets them. You will also need to uninstall AutoCAD 2013 and install the new version. You can follow the instructions on this page to do so. You will also need to activate your license or start your trial period. You can find more information about licensing and activation here.
  
If you decide to downgrade your operating system, you will need to backup your files and settings and perform a clean installation of Windows 7 or 8. You will also need to reinstall AutoCAD 2013 and any other software that you use. You can follow the steps on this page to downgrade your operating system. You will also need to update your drivers and security software to ensure that your computer runs smoothly.
  
Whatever option you choose, we recommend that you backup your data and create a restore point before making any changes to your system. This way, you can revert to a previous state if something goes wrong. We hope that this helps you resolve your issue and enjoy using AutoCAD.
