> "Agneepath (2012), however, will be remembered for Sanjay Datt as Kancha Cheena and Rishi Kapoor as Rauf Lala. First half of movie, is racy,compelling and entertaining equally, thanks to brilliantly shot sequences, tight screenplay, heart-throbbing background score and power packed performances." - *IMDb user* [^3^]

> "The new Agneepath is a collage of set pieces without a spine. It's an earnest but inert remake that doesn't have a single moment that makes you feel anything for any of the characters." - *Anupama Chopra*
